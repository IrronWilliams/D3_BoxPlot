<!--
        boxplots are similiar to scatterplots, for boxplots, instead of appending circles for each data point, you append a <g> element.  
        its good rule to always use <g> elements for charts because they allow u to apply labels or other important info to graph.  This 
        means you have to use the transform attribute, which is how <g> elements are positioned on the canvas.
